Files for predicting aflatoxin risk in maize.
"cleaned_afla_FINALmonthly24_nonzero.csv" is the aflatoxin risk database with the various satellite based predictors
"Classified_Risk_MutipleModels_Aflatoxin_2024_Final.R" is the workflow used to model aflatoxin risk in Maize
"prediction_afla_dry2021.tif" & "prediction_afla_dry2018.tif" are the output predictions in current conditions
"prediction_afla_dry2021F.tif" & "prediction_afla_dry2018F.tif" are the output predictions in future conditions (assumptions that rainfall will decrease by 1% and temperature will increase with 1%)
